Bush signed the legislation into law shortly afterward. During each year from 2007 to 2016, four different dollar designs, each bearing the image of a different president, are being released. Living presidents, both current and former, are excluded from the program-thus the roster of presidential honorees currently stands at 37. For these presidents, 38 coins are planned; this is because Grover Cleveland, who to date is the only president to serve multiple nonconsecutive terms, will be represented with two coins. The Presidential dollars are part of the Golden Dollar Program and retain the same golden color as the Sacagawea dollars.

Recently, a new variety was discovered that would not have been possible without the use of this book, and several of the known varieties have now skyrocketed in price above and beyond the premium attached to the so-called common 1879s Reverse of 1878 silver dollars.

Million Dollar Nickels reveals previously unknown information to dealers, and to the public, an outlandish business where dealers pay $10,000 for the privilege to look at a coin, and offer a $1,000,000 to buy a nickel thought to be lost forever. Generations of Americans have searched in vain - even on the side of a desolate highway - for the elusive 1913 Liberty nickel. But the truth lay hidden away, buried deep in numismatic lore.

A unique and indispensable reference work. Unsurpassed in content and scope. When the first edition of Gold Coins of the World made its debut in 1958, it forever changed the way gold coins were collected, cataloged, traded, and priced. For the first time, one book provided a reliable guide for a subject which previously required an often expensive investment in multiple volumes of literature, some of it rare and antique, and much of it badly out-of-date. With the publication of this pioneering work, Robert Friedberg (1912-1963) established himself as an international icon in the field of numismatic literature. The 'Friedberg Numbering System' he developed became then, and remains today, the internationally-recognized standard for systematically identifying any gold coin ever made. From just 384 pages in 1958, Gold Coins of the World has expanded to the extent that it now contains more than triple the information of its ancestor. It still stands alone as the first and only book to describe, catalog and price two millennia of gold, platinum, and palladium coin issues from across the globe. From the first coins of the ancient Greeks to the most recently-issued modern commemoratives, they are all here, an astonishing compilation of more than 21,000 individual coin listings accompanied by over 8,000 actual-size photographs, some of which are only otherwise found in rare, out-of-print books. The prices have been completely updated, for the most part raised substantially, to reflect the dynamics of today's market. Entire sections have been expanded, many illustrations have been added or improved, and hundreds of new discoveries and recent issues have been included for the first time. Arthur Friedberg, recently named Honorary President of the International Association of Professional Numismatists, and Ira Friedberg, have completely revised and expanded their late father's work. They have been fortunate to have had the valuable assistance and cooperation of a who's who of the leading numismatists on every continent in bringing this edition to fruition. For the numismatist, banker, economist, historian, institution of higher learning, or a fancier of the noble metal in all its forms, Gold Coins of the World is a book for every library, public and private.",,,Local,,No,No,Doba product,BGO:WGC,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amazon item condition,,0,0,0,,,,New,,,,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BGO:WGC,0

All the 360 types he is known to have forged are illustrated well enough to make die matching possible, making this an invaluable reference.",,,Local,,No,No,Doba product,BGR:6283,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amazon item condition,,0,0,0,,,,New,,,,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BGR:6283,0

Murray revolutionized the then little-understood subject of star notes and Large Size United States currency with the publication of the Handbook of United States Large Size Star Notes 1910-1929. Murray took previously unknown information and produced two editions of a book that has been a necessity for all serious collectors and dealers for over twenty years. Star notes are relatively well known on current-size United States currency and their explanation is fairly straightforward: When a note is found to be imperfect in the course of manufacture, it is replaced with a star note, that is a note bearing a star either before or after the serial number. A star note is also used for the 100,000,000th note in a series since the numbering machines cannot print over eight digits. In all other respects, a star note is indistinguishable from regular notes, and of course, worth the same face value. Star replacement notes did not appear on large size currency until 1910 (before then there were instances where stars were part of the design). Prior to 1910, misprints were replaced by exact duplicates of the same serial number made by hand. When Murray began his research, no then-published catalog contained any information on the subject. He discovered 2,100 notes to list in the first edition and by the time of the second edition in 1996 he had identified a total of 3,620. Now, twenty-two years later, an additional 2,677 star serial numbers have been added to the census of known notes. Additionally, all 6,296 serial numbers now identified include the date that they were made known to the author. Astoundingly, government records indicate that about 95 million large size star notes were printed in total. Thus, only a minuscule .007% of the notes produced are known today. All twenty-nine different types of star notes are illustrated and listed, first by type (United States Notes, Silver Certificates, Federal Reserve Bank Notes, Federal Reserve Notes, and Gold Certificates), and then by denomination. Prices were researched and compiled by Ray Alfini and are given in five grades from VG-F (Very Good -Fine) to CU (Crisp Uncirculated). Not only is each note listed with its corresponding Friedberg number, but Murray has also devised a Murray numbering system specifically for this book. Another section of the catalog contains a sequential list of all known large size serial numbers by type, cross referenced to both Friedberg and Murray numbers. Wherever possible, both face and back plate data as well as the approximate condition of each note is included. An addendum lists the results of some landmark star note auctions",,,Local,,No,No,Doba product,BPM:6336,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amazon item condition,,0,0,0,,,,New,,,,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,BPM:6336,0

Ball&rsquo;s treatise on Confederate bonds. Their cries have been heard and their prayers have finally been answered. Though Dr. Ball passed away in 2003, Dr. Henry F. Simmons, Jr. has admirably stepped forward to correct numerous errors that were discovered after the publication of first edition, and to create a significantly more collector friendly work describing these fascinating financial documents. Though retaining as much of Dr. Ball&rsquo;s initial research and structure as possible, Dr. Simmons has made the historical aspects of the bonds and their authorizing Congressional acts more understandable to the layman and specialist alike. Additional items have been added to the introductory text including short biographies of the principal individuals depicted on the bonds, as well as expanded general information regarding bond sizes, the type and quality of the paper used in their production, and how to determine when a bond is historically accurate or has been altered since its issuance. These topics are presented with the collector in mind, though the specialists and dealers will undoubtedly discover something new. As in Dr. Ball&rsquo;s original work, the body of this book, over 200 pages, is devoted to the cataloguing of the actual bonds. These are arranged by the Confederate Congressional act under which they were issued, with an historical perspective of each act at the beginning of the representative bonds. Pertinent information for each bond is provided, including the number issued, the date of issue and maturation, the printer, with variations noted to each of the main types. Additional information is provided regarding the bonds issued in the Trans-Mississippi Department, as well as an expanded section on counterfeit bonds. Dr. Ball&rsquo;s original catalogue numbers have been retained throughout, since many dealers and auction houses have adopted this system for their catalogues and sales. This numbering system is considerably more detailed than that used in Grover Criswell&rsquo;s earlier work, though Criswell numbers are still found on bonds in many dealers&rsquo; inventories. A cross reference listing the Criswell-Ball and Ball-Criswell numbering systems is included at the close of the actual bond list, thereby facilitating the identification of any bond the collector may encounter. In contrast to Dr. Ball&rsquo;s work, the bonds in this book are illustrated in color, with numerous close-ups still being used to highlight the differences of the various sub-types. A rarity scale listing estimated extant specimens is included, with each bond being assigned a corresponding rarity number. Values are presented in two grades, with additional factors affecting the price being noted and explained. Illustrations, also in color, of select state issued bonds provide an interesting conclusion to this much needed update. Whether you are a serious collector of Confederate bonds or have just a passing interest, this book is for you.

This landmark work is the standard reference on American currency since 1953, acknowledged as the most comprehensive and universally recognized guide on the subject, illustrating and valuating all types of United States paper money. From the first year of Federal paper money, 1861, to date, both sides of all currency, from 3 cents to $100,000 are illustrated and accompanied by text listing, describing and pricing, in up to seven conditions, every variety of paper money ever issued. The result is a complete pictorial, descriptive and numismatic history of United States currency. Also with sections on Colonial and Continental currency and the Confederate States of America, and chapters on error notes, encased postage stamps and postage envelopes. For those who think of America's currency as a constant study in green and black, the rainbow-like diversity shown by the more than 800 color illustrations is a revelation in itself. New information has been added and valuations updated, making it possible to establish the value of any note. Paper Money of the United States has been an invaluable asset to currency collectors and numismatists. It also possesses an appeal and value to lovers of Americana, of the fine art of engraving, and students of American history, finance and economics. Banks will find this book especially useful in that it makes possible the immediate identification and valuation of all obsolete but still legal tender currency.

This book chronicles the amazing history of the California Gold Rush, which brought hundreds of thousands of hopefuls to the rugged Wild West of the United States. Through that hope, two brothers stumbled across the greatest silver find in history, in what we now know as the State of Nevada. In the 1860s it was the birthplace of a mining industry that inspired the dreams of thousands and the creation of a camp that today is Carson City, Nevada, where eventually the U.S. Mint would start a branch and the famous ""CC"" Morgan dollars would be struck.

Just about every kid had a pocketful of ""Indian pennies,"" and older folks used them as well. Several of them could buy a newspaper, or candy, or a streetcar ride. Drop a cent into the slot, turn the crank, and you would be dazzled by an automobile racing around a track, or a boxing match, or a vaudeville show. Indian Head cents were anywhere and everywhere. Now, in the fully updated 2nd edition of A guide book of Flying Eagle and Indian Head Cents, Rick Snow examines these beautiful coins by date, mintage, production, survivability, collecting challenges, and variety.
