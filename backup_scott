One of the most outstanding features is the consistent quality of Dansco Coin products which means that we rarely have any quality issues. Dansco coin albums are made with interchangeable parts that allow your collections to grow and make it easy for you to replace pages if needed.</p>  <h3>Dansco Album Components</h3>  <strong>The Binder</strong> &ndash; Simulated leather embossed and beautifully foil stamped. The inside covers of <em>most</em> albums contain a historical overview of the collection and mintage figures for each production hear. The center column is permanently riveted to the exterior binder and holds the pages in place by way of two metal post screws/nuts, which make page replacement easy for anyone.<br /><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>The Pages</strong> &ndash; Loose-leaf hinged pages that are plastic coated and washable. Each page has coin ports that hold coins between acetate slides that both protect and display both sides of your collection. <em>Most</em> pages are imprinted with identifying information including mint mark (when applicable) and mint years. Adding coins to your Dansco coin album is as simple as pushing the top slide to the right edge of the page, inserting your coin and sliding the acetate sheet back in place.&nbsp;<br /><br />	Albums

The Indian Head Cents 1857-1909 Dansco Album comes in a 5/8" binder and holds up to 69 coins. The album has 3 Dansco pages, each one holding and displaying both U.S. Indian Head cents and U.S. Flying Eagle cents minted from 1857-1909. Flying eagle cents were first minted in 1856, but only 2,000 to 3,000 coins were struck that year. They are extremely rare to find, and therefore the Indian Head cents Dansco Album does not include a specific slot for this 1856 Flying Eagle coin. Indian Head cents and Flying Eagle cents are made of 88% copper and 12% nickel. They are 19 mm in diameter, and each weighs 4.67 grams. All Flying Eagle cents and Indian Head cents were coined at the Philadelphia Mint. Dansco Coin Albums have their pages attached with metal screws, making it easy to add and replace.	9.94999999999999929	04Z:04A	D Cent Folders	5.96999999999999975	DANSCO INC.	04Z:90	782

Bush signed the legislation into law shortly afterward. During each year from 2007 to 2016, four different dollar designs, each bearing the image of a different president, are being released. Living presidents, both current and former, are excluded from the program&mdash;thus the roster of presidential honorees currently stands at 37. For these presidents, 38 coins are planned; this is because Grover Cleveland, who to date is the only president to serve multiple nonconsecutive terms, will be represented with two coins. The Presidential dollars are part of the Golden Dollar Program and retain the same golden color as the Sacagawea dollars. The motto IN GOD WE TRUST appears in edge lettering&mdash;a first for a U.S. coin, as the motto has never before appeared on the rim. The year of issue is likewise on the rim.

Recently, a new variety was discovered that would not have been possible without the use of this book, and several of the known varieties have now skyrocketed in price above and beyond the premium attached to the so-called common 1879s Reverse of 1878 silver dollars. I strongly recommend you buy this book for your library. You might have one of the rare Morgan Silver Dollars, or you might be able to find one hidden in your local coin store or at a coin show.</span>	35.9500000000000028	B100	Dollar Books	22	RCI	B100:WANG	716

Framed in the backdrop of a nation-wide media frenzy is a story of eccentric and famous collectors, persistent reporters searching for the truth, an anonymous heiress, shameless profiteers, and agents of the Smithsonian desperate to stay above the fray. Million Dollar Nickels reveals previously unknown information to dealers, and to the public, an outlandish business where dealers pay $10,000 for the privilege to look at a coin, and offer a $1,000,000 to buy a nickel thought to be lost forever. Generations of Americans have searched in vain - even on the side of a desolate highway - for the elusive 1913 Liberty nickel. But the truth lay hidden away, buried deep in numismatic lore. In the end, under the watchful gaze of armed guards, six of the nations most respected coin experts sat in a small room. No one expected what they found, and what they found rewrote numismatic history.	26.9499999999999993	B5	Nickel Books	12.9399999999999995	ZYRUS PRESS & NY MINT	B5:MDN	723

Unsurpassed in content and scope. When the first edition of Gold Coins of the World made its debut in 1958, it forever changed the way gold coins were collected, cataloged, traded, and priced. For the first time, one book provided a reliable guide for a subject which previously required an often expensive investment in multiple volumes of literature, some of it rare and antique, and much of it badly out-of-date. With the publication of this pioneering work, Robert Friedberg (1912-1963) established himself as an international icon in the field of numismatic literature. The 'Friedberg Numbering System' he developed became then, and remains today, the internationally-recognized standard for systematically identifying any gold coin ever made. From just 384 pages in 1958, Gold Coins of the World has expanded to the extent that it now contains more than triple the information of its ancestor. It still stands alone as the first and only book to describe, catalog and price two millennia of gold, platinum, and palladium coin issues from across the globe. From the first coins of the ancient Greeks to the most recently-issued modern commemoratives, they are all here, an astonishing compilation of more than 21,000 individual coin listings accompanied by over 8,000 actual-size photographs, some of which are only otherwise found in rare, out-of-print books. The prices have been completely updated, for the most part raised substantially, to reflect the dynamics of today's market. Entire sections have been expanded, many illustrations have been added or improved, and hundreds of new discoveries and recent issues have been included for the first time. Arthur Friedberg, recently named Honorary President of the International Association of Professional Numismatists, and Ira Friedberg, have completely revised and expanded their late father's work. They have been fortunate to have had the valuable assistance and cooperation of a who's who of the leading numismatists on every continent in bringing this edition to fruition. For the numismatist, banker, economist, historian, institution of higher learning, or a fancier of the noble metal in all its forms, Gold Coins of the World is a book for every library, public and private.	89.9500000000000028	BGO	Gold Coin Books 	53.9699999999999989	REFERENCE BOOKS DISTRIBUTOR	BGO:WGC	720

This turbulent period, during which the Empire came close to total collapse and disintegration, witnessed great changes in the Imperial coinage including unprecedented debasement and the beginning of the decentralization of the mint system. The introductory articles are again included in this volume and, as with Volumes I and II, the Imperial biographies have been entirely rewritten and enlarged. There has been a major expansion of the catalogue listings and special emphasis has been placed on the place of mintage and precise date of issue of each catalogue entry, making this book a far more valuable source of information than previous editions (or any other general work on the subject). The extensive 3rd century coinage of Roman Egypt, struck at Alexandria, is also covered comprehensively in continuation of the format established in the two previous volumes of the Millennium Edition. The number and quality of the illustrations incorporated in the text has been increased to over 900 out of a total listing of more than 4,000 types.	84.25	BO	Oddball Books	53.490000000000002	MEGHRIG	BO:R109	714

The result is a complete pictorial, descriptive and numismatic history of United States currency.

For those who think of America's currency as a constant study in green and black, the rainbow-like diversity shown by the more than 800 color illustrations is a revelation in itself. New information has been added and valuations updated, making it possible to establish the value of any note. Paper Money of the United States has been an invaluable asset to currency collectors and numismatists.

Banks will find this book especially useful in that it makes possible the immediate identification and valuation of all obsolete but still legal tender currency. It is a book which belongs in every library, public and private.	42.5	BPM	U.S. Paper Money Books	29.75	MEGHRIG	BPM:FPMUS	667

The story of their birth, however, goes back much farther. This book chronicles the amazing history of the California Gold Rush, which brought hundreds of thousands of hopefuls to the rugged Wild West of the United States. Through that hope, two brothers stumbled across the greatest silver find in history, in what we now know as the State of Nevada. In the 1860s it was the birthplace of a mining industry that inspired the dreams of thousands and the creation of a camp that today is Carson City, Nevada, where eventually the U.S. Mint would start a branch and the famous "CC" Morgan dollars would be struck. Coins dealers and published researchers Adam Crum, Selby Ungar, and Jeff Oxman tell the story and present a rich study of each Carson City Morgan dollar, with detailed analysis for collectors, investors, and historians alike. The fully updated 3rd edition includes new photographs and ongoing research and market information.	24.9499999999999993	BW	Whitman Books	14.9700000000000006	WHITMAN PUBLISHING	BW:MDCC3	727

In the Guide Book of Peace Dollars, award-winning author Roger W. Burdette explores these fascinating and collectible coins, covering every date and mintmark of America s last 90% silver dollar. He also studies the mysterious 1964-D Peace dollar, as well as Proofs, patterns, trial pieces, errors and misstrikes, countermarks, die varieties, and famous collections. Burdette explores the origins and history of the Peace dollar (including the American Numismatic Association s involvement), early designs and casts, the coin s production process, ways to collect, preservation, the market effect of hoards and meltings, and unusual examples. Other features include a coin-by-coin analysis with market values and certified population data, biographies of key participants in the Peace dollar s story, Van Allen Mallis numbers, a bibliography, and more. The classic Peace dollar evokes the end of the Great War, the celebrations of the Roaring Twenties, fancy cars and flappers, Great Gatsby style riches, and the dramatic stock-market crash of 1929. Roger Burdette has captured the romance of these large silver coins, including the mysterious 1964, and shows you how to form a valuable, high-quality collection. Q.

The inside of the holder, the part that is in contact with the coin, is coated in a mylar film. Mylar is the perfect material to protect coins because it will not tear or scratch. Mylar also has a very low permeability, meaning that it will not let dust or water vapor in to damage coins. In addition to their economical cost, cardboard 2x2s are popular among coin collectors because coin information can be written directly on the holder.	3.18999999999999995	RCGS	Robert C Gray Supplies	1.8899999999999999	VIRG MARSHALL III, INC.	01:VM01	642

Bush signed the legislation into law shortly afterward. During each year from 2007 to 2016, four different dollar designs, each bearing the image of a different president, are being released. Living presidents, both current and former, are excluded from the program&mdash;thus the roster of presidential honorees currently stands at 37. For these presidents, 38 coins are planned; this is because Grover Cleveland, who to date is the only president to serve multiple nonconsecutive terms, will be represented with two coins. The Presidential dollars are part of the Golden Dollar Program and retain the same golden color as the Sacagawea dollars. The motto IN GOD WE TRUST appears in edge lettering&mdash;a first for a U.S. coin, as the motto has never before appeared on the rim. The year of issue is likewise on the rim. Permalock size 6.5" x 6.5". 8 Openings.	6.99000000000000021	10SD	Small Dollar Frosty Cases	4.19000000000000039	WHITMAN PUBLISHING	10SD:1863	679

Hill, was originally published in 1924. This is an excellent book on the die-struck fakes by Carl Wilhem Becker, who worked in the 1820's and is considered by many to be the most talented forger of classical Greek and Roman coins that ever lived. His forgeries still fool the occasional collector and dealer, and are collected and have considerable value in their own right. All the 360 types he is known to have forged are illustrated well enough to make die matching possible, making this an invaluable reference.	20	BGR	Grading & Counterfeit Books	10	DURST PUBLICATIONS	BGR:6283	721

Murray revolutionized the then little-understood subject of star notes and Large Size United States currency with the publication of the Handbook of United States Large Size Star Notes 1910-1929. Murray took previously unknown information and produced two editions of a book that has been a necessity for all serious collectors and dealers for over twenty years. Star notes are relatively well known on current-size United States currency and their explanation is fairly straightforward: When a note is found to be imperfect in the course of manufacture, it is replaced with a star note, that is a note bearing a star either before or after the serial number. A star note is also used for the 100,000,000th note in a series since the numbering machines cannot print over eight digits. In all other respects, a star note is indistinguishable from regular notes, and of course, worth the same face value. Star replacement notes did not appear on large size currency until 1910 (before then there were instances where stars were part of the design). Prior to 1910, misprints were replaced by exact duplicates of the same serial number made by hand. When Murray began his research, no then-published catalog contained any information on the subject. He discovered 2,100 notes to list in the first edition and by the time of the second edition in 1996 he had identified a total of 3,620. Now, twenty-two years later, an additional 2,677 star serial numbers have been added to the census of known notes. Additionally, all 6,296 serial numbers now identified include the date that they were made known to the author. Astoundingly, government records indicate that about 95 million large size star notes were printed in total. Thus, only a minuscule .007% of the notes produced are known today. All twenty-nine different types of star notes are illustrated and listed, first by type (United States Notes, Silver Certificates, Federal Reserve Bank Notes, Federal Reserve Notes, and Gold Certificates), and then by denomination. Prices were researched and compiled by Ray Alfini and are given in five grades from VG-F (Very Good -Fine) to CU (Crisp Uncirculated). Not only is each note listed with its corresponding Friedberg number, but Murray has also devised a Murray numbering system specifically for this book. Another section of the catalog contains a sequential list of all known large size serial numbers by type, cross referenced to both Friedberg and Murray numbers. Wherever possible, both face and back plate data as well as the approximate condition of each note is included. An addendum lists the results of some landmark star note auctions	29.5	BPM	U.S. Paper Money Books	19.6499999999999986	REFERENCE BOOKS DISTRIBUTOR	BPM:6336	667

Ball&rsquo;s treatise on Confederate bonds. Their cries have been heard and their prayers have finally been answered. Though Dr. Ball passed away in 2003, Dr. Henry F. Simmons, Jr. has admirably stepped forward to correct numerous errors that were discovered after the publication of first edition, and to create a significantly more collector friendly work describing these fascinating financial documents. Though retaining as much of Dr. Ball&rsquo;s initial research and structure as possible, Dr. Simmons has made the historical aspects of the bonds and their authorizing Congressional acts more understandable to the layman and specialist alike. Additional items have been added to the introductory text including short biographies of the principal individuals depicted on the bonds, as well as expanded general information regarding bond sizes, the type and quality of the paper used in their production, and how to determine when a bond is historically accurate or has been altered since its issuance. These topics are presented with the collector in mind, though the specialists and dealers will undoubtedly discover something new. As in Dr. Ball&rsquo;s original work, the body of this book, over 200 pages, is devoted to the cataloguing of the actual bonds. These are arranged by the Confederate Congressional act under which they were issued, with an historical perspective of each act at the beginning of the representative bonds. Pertinent information for each bond is provided, including the number issued, the date of issue and maturation, the printer, with variations noted to each of the main types. Additional information is provided regarding the bonds issued in the Trans-Mississippi Department, as well as an expanded section on counterfeit bonds. Dr. Ball&rsquo;s original catalogue numbers have been retained throughout, since many dealers and auction houses have adopted this system for their catalogues and sales. This numbering system is considerably more detailed than that used in Grover Criswell&rsquo;s earlier work, though Criswell numbers are still found on bonds in many dealers&rsquo; inventories. A cross reference listing the Criswell-Ball and Ball-Criswell numbering systems is included at the close of the actual bond list, thereby facilitating the identification of any bond the collector may encounter. In contrast to Dr. Ball&rsquo;s work, the bonds in this book are illustrated in color, with numerous close-ups still being used to highlight the differences of the various sub-types. A rarity scale listing estimated extant specimens is included, with each bond being assigned a corresponding rarity number. Values are presented in two grades, with additional factors affecting the price being noted and explained. Illustrations, also in color, of select state issued bonds provide an interesting conclusion to this much needed update. Whether you are a serious collector of Confederate bonds or have just a passing interest, this book is for you. Order yours today. </span>	40	BPM	U.S. Paper Money Books	20	BNR PRESS	BPM:6356	667

Yeoman's Guide Book of United States Coins when first issued totaled 18,000 copies - a small quantity by today's standards. The "Red Book" quickly grew into the world's most popular numismatic reference, and one of the best-selling nonfiction books of all time. The 1947 Tribute Edition is an exact recreation of the first Red Book. Every page is exactly as it appeared back then: every word, every photograph, every coin value. It's like opening a time capsule of numismatic history. At the back of the book you'll find a full-color section comparing coin collecting of 1947 with the hobby of today. Here are some prices from the book on a few of the Scarcer Lincoln cents in Uncirculated condition: 1909 S $3.75, 1909 S VDB $15.00, 1914 D $10.00 and the 1931 S $1.35. By comparing the prices from 1947 to today's prices it should give you some insight as to what these same coins could possibly be valued at in another 60 years. The coins that appreciated the most from then till now will more than likely be the same coins to continue to grow in value at the same pace in the years ahead.	17.9499999999999993	BW	Whitman Books	10.7699999999999996	WHITMAN PUBLISHING	BW:9051LE	727

David Bowers. Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents, minted from 1856 to 1909, were once the most popular, most widely circulated, most plentiful coins in everyday American life. Just about every kid had a pocketful of "Indian pennies," and older folks used them as well. Several of them could buy a newspaper, or candy, or a streetcar ride. Drop a cent into the slot, turn the crank, and you would be dazzled by an automobile racing around a track, or a boxing match, or a vaudeville show. Indian Head cents were anywhere and everywhere. Now, in the fully updated 2nd edition of A guide book of Flying Eagle and Indian Head Cents, Rick Snow examines these beautiful coins by date, mintage, production, survivability, collecting challenges, and variety. His research is bolstred by the usual high-quality Bowers Series treatment: an engaging overview of the series by the "dean of American numismatics." Q. David Bowers; high-quality photographs in full color; market values in multiple grades, including Red, Red/Brown, and Brown Mint States; certified population data; and a wealth of background information. 288 Pages, Softcover, 6x9 inches, Full Color.	19.9499999999999993	BW	Whitman Books	11.9700000000000006	WHITMAN PUBLISHING	BW:RB1	727

Four special illustrated galleries round out the text with a rollicking ride through the history of America's favorite coin-from nickelodeons to "a good five-cent cigar"; from ice cream cones at Coney Island to silent movies "Down at the Bijou Dream."	19.9499999999999993	BW	Whitman Books	11.9700000000000006	WHITMAN PUBLISHING	BW:RB5	727

The inside of the holder, the part that is in contact with the coin, is coated in a mylar film. Mylar is the perfect material to protect coins because it will not tear or scratch. Mylar also has a very low permeability, meaning that it will not let dust or water vapor in to damage coins. In addition to their economical cost, cardboard 2x2s are popular among coin collectors because coin information can be written directly on the holder.	3.18999999999999995	RCGS	Robert C Gray Supplies	1.8899999999999999	VIRG MARSHALL III, INC.	01:VM09	642

Bush signed the legislation into law shortly afterward. During each year from 2007 to 2016, four different dollar designs, each bearing the image of a different president, are being released. Living presidents, both current and former, are excluded from the program-thus the roster of presidential honorees currently stands at 37. For these presidents, 38 coins are planned; this is because Grover Cleveland, who to date is the only president to serve multiple nonconsecutive terms, will be represented with two coins. The Presidential dollars are part of the Golden Dollar Program and retain the same golden color as the Sacagawea dollars. The motto IN GOD WE TRUST appears in edge lettering-a first for a U.S. coin, as the motto has never before appeared on the rim. The year of issue is likewise on the rim. Folder Size 9.0" x 7.25". 80 Openings covering 2007 through the first release in 2016 then 6 unmarked openings for future releases.	22.9499999999999993	02X:A100	Dollar Album	13.7599999999999998	WHITMAN PUBLISHING	02X:2183	621

The Statehood Quarters 2009 P&amp;D with DC &amp; Territories Dansco Album comes in a 5/8" binder and holds up to 24 coins. The album has 2 Dansco pages (series: 7144-1 to 7144-2), each one holding and displaying all Statehood quarters minted in 2009. The United States Mint 50 State Quarters Program started in 1999. The obverse of the coin retained Washington's portrait throughout the entire series. Perhaps the most popular and beloved of all the U.S. coin collections, State quarters have been responsible for drastically increasing the number of coin collectors. The unexpected success of the series led the U.S. Mint to extend the program by adding the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories in 2009. Statehood quarters have a pure copper inner core and an outer layer made of 75% copper and 25% nickel. They measure 24.3 mm, and each weighs 5.67 grams. Dansco Coin Albums have their pages attached with metal screws, making it easy to add and replace.	29.4499999999999993	04A:A25	Quarter Albums	17.6600000000000001	\N	04A:7144	665
